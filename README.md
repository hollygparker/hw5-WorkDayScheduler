# Purpose 
The purpose of this assignment is to use jQuery and Moment.js to create a calendar app that saves and displays input to the page, and color codes the time blocks based on the current hour of the day.

# My Experience
I enjoyed creating this using Moment.js, and I really like that the app is color coded based on the hour of the day.
